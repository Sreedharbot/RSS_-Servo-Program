# RSS_-Servo-Program
Robot Signals & Sensors


This repo is for testing servo with raspiberry pi 3b+

I used python code for controlling the servo.

Things to do in this project are:

* Calibration Servo using Limit Swtich
* Rotating 90Â° after Homing.
* Controlling the servo using potentiometer.
* Detecting objects using ultrasonic sensor.
* If the object is too close  LED, should turn ON.
* If the object is too close, servo should be disable while oprating the potentiometer.
