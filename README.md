# RSS_-Servo-Program
Robot Signals & Sensors

This repo is for testing servo with raspiberry pi 3b+

I used python code for controlling the servo.

Things to do in this project are:

* Calibration Servo using Limit Swtich
* Rotating 90° after Homing.
* Controlling the servo using potentiometer.
* Detecting objects using ultrasonic sensor.
* If the object is too close (Less than 15cm) LED, should turn ON.
* If the object is too close, (Less than 15cm) servo should be disable while oprating the potentiometer.
* When the potentiometer is "0" the servo should move to 0° also should activate LED indicating servo reached 0°. 
* When the potentiometer is "1023" the servo should move to 90° also should activate LED indicating servo reached 90°.
